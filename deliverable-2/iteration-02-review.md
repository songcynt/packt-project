## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

* When: November 1 2021
* Where: BA1190 (CSC301 Tutorial)

## Process - Reflection

#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

* **Working on separate non-related components individually first, then fitting them together afterward**
	* We found that in order to get a head start on development, each of us would first work on a particular distinct component of the app such that we could properly exercise the ideas we had before assembling together. For us, this reduced the amount of time spent communicating and waiting, as it is not necessary to constantly synchronize with each other, especially on components that are not coupled (i.e. are non-related to each other).
	* An example here is that Jedwin can work on the Shopify auxiliary component of the app, while Lucas can work on the Twilio SMS notification component. Christopher can work on the API for the backend which could later be used by Jedwin and Lucas to fit their respective components to the backend.

* **Scheduling and attending weekly meetings with all stakeholders**
	* Both the development team and the partners have weekly opportunities (every Tuesdays at 6 PM) to meet online, give status reports, and demo certain components of the app at their current stages. This allows the partners to share active feedback or clarify any questions or problems we encountered during development.
	* Not just the partners, but also each member of the development team is kept up to speed on how components of the program are progressing. The weekly meetings are considered major synchronization sessions for us. We are very satisfied with this particular format.

* **Referring to a shared feedback and suggestions document accessible by all stakeholders**
	* Our partners suggested sharing a Google document filled with detailed notes including feedback on components like the frontend and further requirements for the app. If there is a particular topic they would like to talk to us about during our weekly meetings, they could add bullet-point notes for everyone to refer to during the meeting. 
	* It is a convenient method for us as we can easily refer to it when working on applicable components of the app. It is also beneficial for members that may miss meetings, as the main ideas can be summarized through these notes and expanded upon by other members if need be.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* **How tasks are assigned, tracked, prioritized, and completed**
	* Originally, we planned to use Trello as a process artifact for tracking what tasks needed to be completed. Here, a task may involve one or more components of the app and could be classified as a feature to do, bug fix to do, ready for review, etc. 
	* We slowly encountered problems with this approach. The major issue was usability. There was nothing wrong with Trello itself, but not many members of our team were actively using it. This meant either outdated or untracked progress was shown to members that were using it.
	* This also hindered any mid-development changes to the app which resulted in one or more components either merging or being dropped entirely. This further contributes to the outdated information.
	* The consensus for the lack of tracking seemed to be general laziness or very slow progress on a particular task that should have been broken down into smaller more manageable tasks.

* **Weak rules on internal team communications**
	* In Deliverable 1, several rules were put in place on how the team is expected to communicate as well as a protocol to follow in the event of an emergency. This included communication channels like Discord or Facebook Messenger, and possible consequences if a particular member is not communicating as expected.
	* Unfortunately, communication in general was limited across all team members. The communication channels were barely being used, and the team has had a less than ideal amount of internal team meetings, preventing integration from happening.
	* Due to the development not being full-time, each member has expressed excuses such as scheduling conflicts with other courses and obligations which prevented work from progressing smoothly.
	* Each member is waiting on other members to finish their tasks, but no one wants to be held responsible for missing the deadline. Furthermore, no check-ups or status reports were requested until the realization of the deadline hit us.

#### Q3. Planned changes

* **Frequency of team communication**
	* As a result of the consequences outlined in section **Q2**, we are planning to encourage and enforce more communication and openness to each other. We should also make a better effort to meet up in person (e.g. all members attends the lecture and tutorial) and schedule more internal team meetings.
	* We expect with more frequent communication and transparency, the development efficiency and efficacy of the app will increase. Each member is highly valued and has the ability to execute their task competently, but perhaps need to be more assertive about themselves and their well-being.

* **Better defined deadlines**
	* The deadlines we set for ourselves on certain components are perhaps too broad (i.e. due by Deliverable 2). This is a problem for certain components that are coupled due to our "individual first, together afterward" approach, as outlined in section **Q1**, because it is not clear on how much time is allocated on fitting components into the app itself and ensuring that it works as intended, which is equally as important as the individual components themselves.
	* We are planning on setting more specific deadlines which will further clarify from a temporal standpoint how the process will be allocated for each part (e.g. development, testing, QA, bugfixes).

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?

* Short demos of the frontend were put together across two weekly partner meetings. 
* The demo consisted of the login screen, authentication mechanism, main user interface, various pages and layouts of the app.
* Some aspects of the demo, such as Shopify integrations and Twilio functionalities, were difficult to display in a live demo, and were instead recorded.
* Minor changes to the interface, such as different colour palettes and adjustments to layout elements were suggested.
* Partner indicated that they were confused on how to use the application, and expressed a desire for usage documentation for the future.
