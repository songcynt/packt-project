# packt-project
Source code for the web application built for Packt. Excludes database setup file and sequelize model files for security (in agreement with client's request). See http://packt-project.herokuapp.com/ for deployed main branch app and https://packt-project-development.herokuapp.com/ for deployed development branch.

This is a 3 month project developed for Packt, a social enterprise based in Toronto, Ontario for course CSC301 Intro to Software Engineering.
This web application was developed by Cynthia Song (me), Christopher Wong, Lucas Zhou, Kavin Singh, and Jedwin Mok in collaboration with our project partners Beth Szurpicki and Agatha Rudd.

No license was applied to this project, Packt has ownership of commercial product, but our team has rights to publish portion of the source code.

Note: you can cd into client folder and yarn start to run React project, but yarn start from root directory will not work as some backend code has been removed per client request.

See client/public/deliverable-1 for planning.md and deliverable-2 for documentation.
